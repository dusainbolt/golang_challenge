# Challenge 06 - Implementing a Queue in Go

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome Gophers! In this challenge, we are going to be implementing some of the basic functionality of the `Queue` data structure in Go.

This is going to be the first of a number of data-structure questions which may come in handy if you are about to go in for an interview!

Weâ€™ll be carrying on the theme of flying from the previous challenge here and implementing 3 crucial methods needed to support a basic implementation of a Queue.

## Push

The first challenge will be to implement the `Push` function of our Queue data structure.

This method will take in a Flight and `push` the flight onto the back of our `Items` queue.

## Peek

The second part of this challenge will be implementing the `Peek` function.

This method will allow us to view what item is at the front of our queue but not modify the underlying stack values.

## Pop

The third and final part of this challenge will be implementing the `Pop` function.

This method will allow us to `pop` an element off the front of our `Items` queue and return to us the first flight.
