# Challenge 07 - Minimums, Maximums and Errors

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome Gophers! In this challenge, weâ€™ll be testing your ability to handle edge cases and work with the `errors` package.

In this challenge, you have the task of implementing the `GetMinMax` function which will take in a `slice` of type Flight.

The function will return 3 values:

* `min` - The cheapest price from the list passed in.
* `max` - The most expensive price from the list passed in.
* `error` - Any error values should there be issues with the list passed in.
