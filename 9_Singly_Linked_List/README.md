# Challenge 09 - ðŸ”— Singly Linked Lists

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome Gophers! In this challenge, you will be implementing some of the basic functionality of a singly linked-list in Go! ðŸ’ª

In this challenge, we will be attempted to implement the `Add` function of a  *singly linked list* .

## Linked Lists

Linked lists are a data structure we can utilize in order to represent a sequence of elements or `nodes` as they are called. Singly linked lists are a one way sequence where each `node` contains a pointer to the next `node` in the list.

Doubly linked lists on the other hand have 2 pointers to both the previous `node` and the next `node` and can be traversed back and forth.
