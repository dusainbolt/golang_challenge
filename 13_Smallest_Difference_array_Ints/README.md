# Challenge 13 - Smallest Difference between Ints

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome Gophers! In this challenge, you are tasked with finding the smallest difference between two slices of `int` values.

> Example: Letâ€™s say I have 2 int arrays; [1, 2] and [4, 5]. The function should return the smallest difference which would be the difference between `2` and `4`.
