# Challenge 08 - Check Permutations

👋 Welcome Gophers! In this Go challenge, you are going to be implementing a function that takes in two `string` values and checks to see if they are permutations of one another.

## Example

If I have 2 strings, “abc” and “cba”, when I pass these strings into the function, it should return `true` as these two strings are permutations of each other.
