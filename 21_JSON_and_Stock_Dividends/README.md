# Challenge 21 - JSON and Stock Dividends

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome Gophers! In this Go challenge, you are going to be working with JSON data and implementing a function that takes in a JSON string full of stock quotes and returns the one with the highest dividend return.

You will need to implement the `HighestDividend` function so that it takes in a `JSON` string. You will then need to somehow convert this JSON string into something you can traverse in Go using the `encoding/json` package.

Finally, you will need to return the string `ticker` for the stock that has the highest dividend.
