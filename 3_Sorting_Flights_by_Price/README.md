# Challenge 03 - Sorting Flights by Price

In this challenge, you are going to be attempting to sort a list of `Flights` based on their **price from highest to lowest**.

---

## Task

You will have to implement the `SortByPrice` function that takes in a slice of type `Flight` and returns the sorted list of `Flights`.

---

## Hint

In order to help you see what is going on, you have been provided with a very quick `printFlights` function which you can use to print the flights out.
