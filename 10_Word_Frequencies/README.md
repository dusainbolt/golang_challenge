# Challenge 10 - Word Frequencies

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome Gophers! In this challenge, you will be tasked with efficiently counting the word frequencies of a large body of text in Go!

You will have to implement a function which keeps track of the number of times a word appears in a body of text and then you will have to implement a further function which returns the top 5 most frequent words from highest to lowest.
