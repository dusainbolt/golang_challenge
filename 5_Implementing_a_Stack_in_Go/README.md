# Challenge 05 - Implementing a Stack in Go

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome Gophers! In this challenge, we are going to be implementing some of the basic functionality of the `Stack` data structure in Go.

This is going to be the first of a number of data-structure questions which may come in handy if you are about to go in for an interview!

Weâ€™ll be carrying on the theme of flying from the previous challenge here and implementing 3 crucial methods needed to support a basic implementation of a stack.

## Push

The first challenge will be to implement the `Push` function of our Stack interface.

This method will take in a Flight and `push` the flight onto the top of our `Items` stack.

## Peek

The second part of this challenge will be implementing the `Peek` function.

This method will allow us to view what item is at the top of our stack but not modify the underlying stack values.

## Pop

The third and final part of this challenge will be implementing the `Pop` function.

This method will allow us to `pop` an element off the top of our `Items` stack and return to us the top flight.
