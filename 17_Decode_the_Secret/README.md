# Challenge 17 - Decode the Secret

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome Gophers! In this challenge, you are tasked with decoding the secret message.

You will need to implement the `DecodeSecret` function which will take in a string that has been encoded using base64 encoding and decode this string.

This decoded string will be the result of a caesar cipher which has shifted all of the characters of the string up by 1 place. So you will have to ensure that when you return the result, it also decodes this cipher.
